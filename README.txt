*********************** Final Project 'Professional Software and Career Practises' *************************

This repository includes the code I used in order to transform and manipulate the data I collected to then
create figures I can use in my report to visualise the data.



****** Files in the Repository ******

I will explain the purpose for the files in my repository:

code1.py:

    - This is the main code file. Includes all my code on functions, importing, transforming the data.
      This is also the file the in which I create my datasets and figures in.

unit_tests.py:

    - The file which contains all my unit tests created. They test independent functions whcih can be tested
      independently

requirements.txt:

    - This is a file that circle.ci reads in order to test my unit tests, including the imported libraries I
      used. This was done by running 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' in the terminal of my enviroment
